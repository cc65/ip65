In this mode, data is converted between the PETSCII character set and standard ASCII - you will need to shift to the "lower case" char set for this to display properly.
<br><br> The PETSCII mode is appropriate for connecting to e.g. a PETSCII BBS. The ASCII mode is appropriate for connecting to a server running a "network ASCII" derived protocol, e.g. SMTP or HTTP.

<h2>Magic Variables</h2>
The following BASIC variables are set by the TCP commands and POLL.
<h3>CO%</h3>
<li>CO%=1 means there is a current TCP connection</li>
<li>CO%=0 means there is no current TCP connection (either one has never been opened, or else it has been closed)

<h3>ER%</h3>
ER% is set to indicate any error occuring inside the <a href=http://ip65.sourceforge.net/>ip65 TCP/IP stack</a> that Kipper BASIC is built on top of.
Possible values:

<h2>STARTUP</h2>
If you try and load Kipper BASIC twice (or some other BASIC extender before Kipper BASIC) you will get an 'insufficient memory' error.
<br>
<br>

After Kipper BASIC has been installed, it will attempt to load (and run) a file (from whatever device Kipper BASIC was loaded from) called "AUTOEXEC.BAS". 
If this file does not exist, then Kipper BASIC will exit with 'FILE NOT FOUND ERROR IN 10". This error can be ignored - you can load any file you want from then, or type
in a new one, or even use the commands in interactive mode.
<br>
<br>
For example, try:
<pre>
DHCP:NETCAT"JAMTRONIX.COM",6464
</pre>
